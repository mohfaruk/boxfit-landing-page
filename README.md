## Business Website

A website I built for a non-existant Sports Fitness Company. I created a professional website design to test my front-end skills using HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript.

## Lessons Learned

I thoroughly enjoyed the process of building this website, and reminded me how much you can do with just CSS and JavaScript.

I used JavaScript to include a responsive hamburger navbar when the website is accessed on smaller devices. This is vital due to how common websites are access on mobile phones and tablets. Moreover, I JavaScript allowed me to create a navbar that would be fixed when users would scroll down adding to the websites functionality.

The website still requires a payment feature to be included. I have limited knowledge of this, apart from Stripe being a popular payment processor used by many online businesses. I intend on reading into this further so I have a better understanding of its implementation.

## Future Updates

• Adding a payment system with Stripe.

• Including a fake location in the contact section, using the Google Maps API to showcase this.

## Deployment

Website was deployed with vercel.
